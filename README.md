# OlinWikiHub
Lab 1 for OlinJS with ReactJS.

Uses express for routing authenticated github requests through the server and keeping a list of added repositories.
(Github list of repos does not contain information on the parent of forked repositories)
Relevant github calls and callback helpers located in routes as well. 

Everything else is on the client-side. JSX files are located under public/jsx. index.jsx is where it all starts, and components are loaded from the components folder. 

Relevant server and github calls from the client located in public/javascripts. (utils is just utils).
